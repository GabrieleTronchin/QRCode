# QR Code Generation with .NET Core

This project serves as a basic example of how to use the QRCoder library in a .NET Core application to generate QR Codes, provide them for download, and handle multiple QR Code generations at once. 

It is based on a NuGet package called QRCoder, which can be found here: [QRCoder GitHub Repository](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder).

This project exposes three endpoints:
- One that generates a QR Code from a text input.
- One that generates a QR Code and allows downloading it as a PNG file.
- One that takes a series of texts as input, generates QR Codes for each, and produces a zip file containing all the generated QR Codes.

Feel free to fork the repository and modify it to fit your specific use case.
